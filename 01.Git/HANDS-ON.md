# Getting Started

In the next chapters you will learn about Azure DevOps and it's features, but for now
get ready to meet Repositories in Azure DevOps's git!

# Task
In DevOps project:
- Create a repo with the next format: [name]-training
- Create a new branch with the name of the chapter: ITTools



# Disclaimer
- For each chapter with hands on script task, create a new branch, after you finish the task,
do a pull request to the branch "main" so someone from the team will do a code review before merging into main.
We work this way in all of our big projects so the "production" version of the code will be clean.

A quick example:

1. Created a new branch "ITTools" from "main" 
2. Started a new script for the ITTools chapter
3. Commiting changes into ITTools
4. When ready, do a pull request into "main"
5. Call someone from the team to check
6. Teamate accepts, merges and you can move on and create a new branch for the next chapter!
