- The trainee will understand how to handle users and groups in a Linux machine
- The trainee will know the files in Linux which related to the users and groups
- The trainee will know how to change users in a Linux machine
- The trainee will know how to execute programs as another user

### Tasks
- Read about users and groups in a Linux machine
- Explain the terms UID and GID
- What do the following commands do:
  - `whoami`
  - `id`
- Create a new user using the `useradd` command
- Create a new group using the `groupadd` command
- Use `usermod` to add the new user to the new group
- Use `groupmod` to change the name of the new group
- Change the new user's password (use `passwd`)
- Read and understand the purpose of the following files:
  - /etc/passwd
  - /etc/shadow
  - /etc/group
- Explain the purpose of each segment of a record in /etc/passwd
- Why is there an 'x' in the second segment?
- Explain the purpose of each segment of a record in /etc/shadow
- The second segment is also divided by a '$' as a delimiter, what is the purpose of each segment there?
- Use `su` to switch into the new user
- What is the differences between `su [user]` and `su - [user]`?
- Give the new user permission to use `sudo` by adding him to a group
- Remove the new user from said group, and use `visudo` to add the user's group as a sudoer
- What file does `visudo` open?
- What is the difference between `sudo` and `sudoedit`?
- Delete the new user, then create another user without using `useradd` (edit and copy files as needed)
