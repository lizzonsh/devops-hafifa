### Goals
- The trainee will understand the ssh protocol and how it works.
- The trainee will know the purpose of the important files.
- The trainee will understand the authentication process and different methods.
- The trainee will learn how to configure different types of tunnels.

### Tasks
- Read about the ssh protocol and understand it.
- Explain the changes between SSH version 1 and SSH version 2.
- Scenario: Create 2 vagrant machines. From now on we'll refer to them as 'server1' and 'server2'.
  - ssh to server2 from server1 using a password.
  - Now, let's do this with a key pair. Make it possible to connect to server1 from server2, use the `ssh-keygen` and `ssh-copy-id` commands.
  - Explain the previous authentication process and how it works.
  - If you'll destroy server1 machine and build it again (let's assume the ip address is static and remains the same)
    will you be able to ssh from server2 to server1 (doesn't matter the authentication method)? If not, what should you do to make it possible?
  - Create file1 in your server1 home directory. copy it to /tmp directory in server2.
  - Now copy the same file to your home directory and name it file2 (do it from server1).
