# First task!
Get ready to meet the vSphere!

when we create new virtual machine we have a standrad of calling our VMS:

> do-[name/purpose]

For example: 
> do-build-la 
Is used for a build server for Mador LA

Now create your own virtual machine, in windows:
> do-[your-name]-win

## Notes
- Ask someone from the team in which network to create it
- There is a guide on how to create a VM as for the network share path

**Good Luck!**
